# BIO

Before joining the Natural Language Processing Group in the U, my main interests
are on Computer Architecture and Distributed System, especially on large scale
data processing systems. I got my bachelor and master degree in Huazhong
University of Science and Technology in China, my master thesis is about making
R language running on JVM to gain the power of JVM-based open-source computing
infrastructures such as Hadoop, Spark. Then I joined the U after I worked for 4 years 
in Alibaba, Baidu, Sohu and one startup in ZunClub
